# DBank
This is the Motoko edition of the DBank app. The app allows users to securely store and manage their digital assets.

## Getting Started
To run the app locally, you need to have the DFINITY Canister SDK installed. Once installed, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, execute the following command to start the local development server:

```
dfx start
```
This will start the Internet Computer simulator and serve the app on `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Usage
The DBank app provides a simple and user-friendly interface for users to manage their digital assets. Once logged in, users can view their account balance and transactions, as well as send and receive digital assets to and from other users.

### Prerequisites
- Internet connection
- Web3 wallet (e.g., Metamask)
